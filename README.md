# A Simple and Robust Correlation Filtering method for text-based person search
We provide the code for reproducing results of our ECCV 2022 paper [A Simple and Robust Correlation Filtering method for text-based person search](www.baidu.com). Compared with the original paper, we obtain better performance through some modifications. Specially, following global response map, we also add the same mutual-exclusion-loss to separate body part response map. Our method achieve new state-of-the-art performance and it improves to 64.89 on Top-1 (CUHK-PEDES).
